This project implements a path-searching AI that utilizes both uninformed and informed search algorithms to find optimal paths in a given environment.
The uninformed algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Iterative Deepening Limited Search (IDLS).
The informed algorithms feature Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), A*, Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS), Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*), and Simplified Memory-Bounded A* (SMA*), all leveraging the Manhattan Distance heuristic to guide the search towards the goal efficiently.
The pygame library is used for visualization.
